# Medical Certification Direct Approval Process

## Background

Previously, the medical certification upload and approval process was split into two distinct steps:

1. **Upload & Accept**: Admin uploads certification file which set the status to "accepted"
2. **Review & Approve**: Admin reviews the file in a modal and clicks "Approve" to change status to "approved"

This two-step process was confusing for admins who would select "Accept Certification and Upload" but the system would still require a separate approval step.

## Changes Implemented

We've modified the medical certification upload process to streamline the admin workflow:

1. When an admin uploads a certification file and selects "Approve Certification and Upload", the certification is now automatically set to "approved" status in a single step.
2. The two-step review model is still available for certifications that come in through the system (email, fax, etc.) which admins haven't had a chance to review yet.

## Technical Implementation

The following changes were made:

1. Changed the status parameter in `ApplicationsController#process_accepted_certification` from `:accepted` to `:approved`:

```ruby
# Old implementation
result = MedicalCertificationAttachmentService.attach_certification(
  application: @application,
  blob_or_file: params[:medical_certification],
  status: :accepted,  # This set the status to "accepted"
  # ... other params
)

# New implementation
result = MedicalCertificationAttachmentService.attach_certification(
  application: @application,
  blob_or_file: params[:medical_certification],
  status: :approved,  # Now sets the status directly to "approved"
  # ... other params
)
```

2. Updated the UI to reflect this change:
   - Changed radio button label from "Accept Certification and Upload" to "Approve Certification and Upload"
   - Updated screen reader text from "accept" to "approve" for accessibility

3. Refactored the controller code to improve quality:
   - Extracted common functionality into helper methods
   - Added better error handling and consistent success/error messaging
   - Improved debug logging

## User Experience Improvements

1. **More Intuitive Flow**: When an admin reviews and uploads a certification they received directly (via mail, email, etc.), they can now approve it in a single step.

2. **Reduced Ambiguity**: The UI now clearly indicates that the admin is both uploading and approving the certification.

3. **Consistent Naming**: The labels and messages now consistently use "approve" rather than "accept" to match how the process is described elsewhere in the system.

## Testing Considerations

When testing this feature, verify that:

1. When an admin uploads a certification file through the upload form and selects "Approve", the certification status is immediately set to "approved"
2. An appropriate audit trail is created showing the medical certification was approved
3. The application status is updated appropriately based on this approval
4. All the typical side effects of medical certification approval still occur (notifications, eligibility for vouchers, etc.)
