# Medical Certification Upload Fix

## Problem

There was an issue with medical certification uploads in production where users would encounter the following error:

```
Error storing "medical_certification_valid.pdf". Status: 0
```

This only affected medical certification uploads, while other uploads like income and residency proofs were working correctly.

## Root Cause

After analyzing the logs and code, we found that the direct uploads were succeeding, but the final attachment phase was failing. The key difference between the working `ProofAttachmentService` and our `MedicalCertificationAttachmentService` was in how file uploads were handled.

Specifically, when handling uploaded files of type `ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile`:

1. **ProofAttachmentService (working)** had explicit fallback mechanisms:
   - It set `attachment_param = blob_or_file` at the beginning
   - It explicitly set it again before trying to create a blob
   - This ensured a fallback to the original file if blob creation failed

2. **MedicalCertificationAttachmentService (failing)** didn't explicitly reset the parameter:
   - It set `attachment_param = blob_or_file` at the beginning
   - It attempted to create a blob but didn't explicitly set the fallback
   - If blob creation failed, the fallback wasn't guaranteed

## Solution

The fix involved updating `MedicalCertificationAttachmentService` to match the same approach as `ProofAttachmentService`:

1. Explicitly set the attachment parameter to the uploaded file as a fallback:
   ```ruby
   Rails.logger.info "Using direct file upload attachment: #{blob_or_file.class.name}"
   attachment_param = blob_or_file  # Explicitly set to original file as base case
   ```

2. Added better logging to track the attachment process:
   ```ruby
   Rails.logger.info "Final attachment_param type: #{attachment_param.class.name}"
   ```

3. Improved handling of other file types for consistency:
   - Added support for other string formats that might be valid signed IDs
   - Enhanced error reporting for failed blob creation

## Implementation

We updated the `process_attachment_param` method of `MedicalCertificationAttachmentService` to exactly match the patterns used in `ProofAttachmentService`:

1. Set explicit fallbacks for all attachment parameter types
2. Added comprehensive logging at each step
3. Improved error handling to prevent attachment failures
4. Ensured proper verification of attachments

No changes to the controller or view logic were needed since they were already correctly calling the service.

## Testing

This solution can be tested by:

1. Uploading medical certification in production 
2. Verifying the file appears in the application
3. Checking the logs for successful attachment operations

## Lessons Learned

1. When dealing with file uploads, always have explicit fallback mechanisms
2. Keep attachment logic consistent between similar services
3. Comprehensive logging is crucial for debugging production issues with file uploads
4. Follow proven patterns when implementing similar functionality
