# Deprecated: Chrome for Testing Fix (Old Document)

**Important Notice:**  
This document is deprecated and should no longer be used. We have migrated away from the webdrivers gem and our custom Chrome for Testing configurations in favor of Selenium Manager, which is built into Selenium WebDriver 4.11+.

For the current configuration, best practices, and troubleshooting information on system tests, please refer to the following documents:
- [doc/selenium_manager_migration.md](../doc/selenium_manager_migration.md)
- [doc/system_testing_chrome_update.md](../doc/system_testing_chrome_update.md)

All instructions in this document have been superseded by the above resources.
