# Medical Certification Approval Process

This document provides instructions for uploading and reviewing faxed medical certifications in the MAT Vulcan application.

## Background

When a medical certification is faxed to the office, administrators need to review it and either approve or reject it. Previously, this was a multi-step process:
1. Upload the document
2. View the application
3. Review the medical certification
4. Use a separate process to approve or reject it

The new process allows administrators to approve or reject the certification at the time of upload, saving time and streamlining the workflow.

## Using the Medical Certification Upload Feature

### When to Use This Feature

Use this feature when:
- A medical certification has been faxed to your office
- The certification is for an application that has requested a medical certification
- The certification hasn't already been uploaded

### Process for Approving a Certification

1. Navigate to the application details page
2. Locate the "Upload Faxed Medical Certification" section
3. Select "Accept Certification and Upload"
4. Use the file picker to select the scanned certification document
5. Click "Process Certification"

### Process for Rejecting a Certification

1. Navigate to the application details page
2. Locate the "Upload Faxed Medical Certification" section
3. Select "Reject Certification"
4. You'll see several common rejection reasons - click on one to auto-fill the rejection reason field
5. Add additional notes if needed to help the provider understand what to correct
6. Click "Process Certification"

### What Happens After Processing

For approvals:
- The certification document is attached to the application
- The certification status is updated to "Accepted"
- An audit log entry is created
- The document appears in the certification history

For rejections:
- No document is attached
- The certification status is updated to "Rejected"
- The provider is notified of the rejection reason
- An audit log entry is created
- The rejection appears in the certification history

## Troubleshooting

- If the rejection buttons don't populate the reason field, try clicking a different button or typing your reason manually
- If you don't see the upload form, check that the certification status is "Requested" and no document is already attached
- If the file uploader seems to hang, check that the file is a supported format (PDF, JPG, PNG) and under the maximum size limit
