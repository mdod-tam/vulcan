# Testing and Debugging Guide

This comprehensive guide covers system testing, debugging, and fixing test failures in this Rails application. It consolidates lessons learned from debugging efforts and provides practical strategies for reliable testing.

## Test Suite Overview

The application test suite is consolidated and standardized to ensure reliability and maintainability. Key features of the test suite include:

- A high rate of passing tests with extensive assertions.
- Shared helper modules to reduce code duplication.
- Standardized authentication patterns across all test types.
- Accurate Federal Poverty Level (FPL) calculations.

For more details on the consolidation strategy, see [`test_consolidation_strategy.md`](test_consolidation_strategy.md).

## Quick Start

### Running Tests
```bash
# Minimal output (recommended)
rails test test/system/some_test.rb
./bin/test-quiet test/system/some_test.rb

# Full debugging output
VERBOSE_TESTS=1 rails test test/system/some_test.rb
./bin/test-verbose test/system/some_test.rb

# Special cases
USE_TRUNCATION=1 rails test        # Force truncation strategy
HEADLESS=false rails test          # Visual browser debugging
DEBUG_AUTH=true rails test         # Authentication debug info
```

## Test Configuration & Log Noise Reduction

### Environment Setup
The test suite minimizes log noise by default but can be made verbose for debugging:

- **Log Level**: `:warn` by default, `:debug` with `VERBOSE_TESTS=1`
- **Database Strategy**: `transaction` (fast) by default, `truncation` with `USE_TRUNCATION=1`
- **Browser**: Cuprite (Chrome via CDP) with optimized settings
- **Seeding**: Only shows errors and completion unless verbose mode
- **Auto-loading**: Test support files loaded automatically from `test/support/`

### Browser Configuration
- **Primary Driver**: Cuprite with Chrome
- **Headless Mode**: Controlled by `HEADLESS` environment variable
- **Performance**: Animations disabled, optimized Chrome options
- **Debug Options**: `SLOWMO=0.5` for step-by-step debugging

## Authentication in Tests

### For Unit & Controller Tests
```ruby
include AuthenticationTestHelper

# Sign in with explicit controller method
sign_in_for_controller_test(user)
# Or use the shorter alias
sign_in_as(user)

# Verify the authentication
verify_authentication_state(user)

# Sign out
sign_out
```

### For Integration Tests (ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest)
**Important**: Use `sign_in_for_integration_test(user)` for integration tests to avoid authentication issues:

```ruby
include AuthenticationTestHelper

# Correct pattern for integration tests - use explicit method
sign_in_for_integration_test(@user)
# Or use the shorter alias
sign_in_with_headers(@user)

# Verify authentication state
assert_authenticated(@user)

# AVOID: The flexible sign_in method was removed due to priority detection bugs
# sign_in(@user)  # DON'T use - removed in favor of explicit methods
```

### For Unit/Other Tests
```ruby
include AuthenticationTestHelper

# Sign in for unit tests (just sets Current.user)
sign_in_for_unit_test(user)
# Or use the shorter alias
update_current_user(user)
```

### Rationale for Explicit Methods
The testing framework uses explicit sign-in methods (e.g., `sign_in_for_integration_test`) instead of a single, flexible `sign_in` method. This approach prevents ambiguity and bugs related to automatic context detection, where the test framework might incorrectly guess whether to use a controller or integration-style sign-in. Explicit methods ensure that the correct authentication strategy is always used for the given test type.

### For System Tests
```ruby
include SystemTestAuthentication

# Sign in through UI
system_test_sign_in(user)

# For a specific code block
with_authenticated_user(user) do
  # Code that needs to run with this user
end

# Verify authentication state
assert_authenticated_as(user)

# Sign out
system_test_sign_out
```

### Authentication Core
- Uses `Thread.current[:test_user_id]` consistently across test types
- Shared `AuthenticationCore` module provides common methods
- Automatic session cleanup prevents test interference

## Shared Test Helpers

### FPL Policy Helpers
A centralized FPL policy setup is available to ensure consistent test data.

```ruby
# The setup_fpl_policies helper is available in all tests.
# It creates standardized policies with a 400% modifier.
setup do
  setup_fpl_policies
end
```

The helper sets the following FPL values:
- 1 person: $15,000
- 2 people: $20,000
- 3 people: $25,000
- And so on, based on a 400% modifier.

### Paper Application Context Helpers
Centralized context management is available for paper application tests.

```ruby
# The setup_paper_application_context helper is available in all tests.
# It sets Current.paper_context = true.
setup do
  setup_paper_application_context
end

teardown do
  teardown_paper_application_context
end
```

This helper is essential for testing paper application workflows as it bypasses certain validations that only apply to online submissions.

### Module Locations
```
test/support/
├── fpl_policy_helpers.rb              # FPL policy setup
├── paper_application_context_helpers.rb  # Current attributes context
└── authentication_test_helper.rb      # Authentication methods
```

## Attachment Mocking

### Recommended Approach
Use `AttachmentTestHelper#mock_attached_file` for consistent mocking:

```ruby
# Create a comprehensive mock for an attachment
income_proof_mock = mock_attached_file(
  filename: 'income.pdf',
  content_type: 'application/pdf',
  byte_size: 100.kilobytes,
  attached: true
)

# Stub the attachment on your model
application.stubs(:income_proof).returns(income_proof_mock)
application.stubs(:income_proof_attached?).returns(true)
```

### Factory Traits
```ruby
# Mocked attachments (fast, for unit tests)
create(:application, :with_mocked_income_proof)
create(:application, :with_all_mocked_attachments)

# Real attachments (for integration tests)
create(:application, :with_real_income_proof)
create(:application, :with_all_real_attachments)

# Waiting period handling (for tests creating multiple applications per user)
create(:application, :old_enough_for_new_application, user: @user)
```

### When to Use Each
- **Mocked attachments**: Unit tests, performance-sensitive tests, when you only care about presence/absence
- **Real attachments**: Integration tests, when testing file processing, when testing ActiveStorage behavior
- **`:old_enough_for_new_application`**: Tests that create multiple applications for the same user (avoids waiting period validation conflicts)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. Authentication Issues
**Problem**: User not properly signed in or session state issues.

**Solutions**:

***Use the proper sign-in helpers!***

- ✅ **For Integration Tests**: Use `sign_in_for_integration_test(user)` or `sign_in_with_headers(user)`
- ✅ **For Controller Tests**: Use `sign_in_for_controller_test(user)` or `sign_in_as(user)`
- ✅ **For Unit Tests**: Use `sign_in_for_unit_test(user)` or `update_current_user(user)`
- ✅ **Include Helper**: Ensure `include AuthenticationTestHelper` in test class
- ✅ **Factory Usage**: Use `:constituent` factory instead of `:user, :constituent`
- Use `system_test_sign_in(user)` for system tests
- Use `enhanced_sign_in(user)` for Cuprite-specific tests
- Verify with `assert_authenticated_as(user)`
- Add `wait_for_turbo` after navigation

### 1a. Waiting Period Validation Errors
**Problem**: Tests fail with "You must wait 3 years before submitting a new application" when creating multiple applications for the same user.

**Root Cause**: The waiting period validation prevents users from creating new applications within 3 years of their last application.

**Solution**: Use the `:old_enough_for_new_application` factory trait for the first application:

```ruby
setup do
  @user = create(:constituent)
  # Create an application that's old enough to allow new applications
  @application = create(:application, :old_enough_for_new_application, user: @user)
  sign_in_for_integration_test(@user)
end

# Now tests can create new applications for @user without validation conflicts
test 'user can submit new application' do
  post constituent_portal_applications_path, params: { ... }
  # This will succeed because @application is 4 years old
end
```

**When to Use**:
- Tests that create multiple applications for the same user
- Integration tests testing form submissions
- Any test setup that creates a "baseline" application and then tests creating new ones

**Alternative Approach**: Create different users for each application instead of using the same user multiple times.

### 2. Element Not Found (`Capybara::ElementNotFound`)
**Problem**: Tests can't find or interact with elements.

**Solutions**:
- Use stable selectors (IDs, data attributes)
- Use `visible: :all` for conditionally hidden elements
- Add explicit waits: `assert_selector 'selector', wait: 5`
- Use safe helpers: `safe_click`, `safe_fill_in`

### 3. JavaScript/Stimulus Issues
**Problem**: JavaScript functionality doesn't work as expected.

**Solutions**:
- Verify Stimulus controllers are registered
- Check `data-controller` and `data-target` attributes
- Add waits after JavaScript actions
- Use `wait_for_turbo` for Turbo Stream updates

### 4. Timing Issues & Race Conditions
**Problem**: Tests run faster than UI updates.

**Solutions**:
- Use explicit waits with appropriate timeouts
- Wait for Turbo navigation completion
- Ensure background jobs complete before assertions
- Use `wait` sparingly for complex async sequences (sleep can cause race conditions)

### 5. Database/Backend Errors
**Problem**: Tests trigger backend errors due to data issues.

**Solutions**:
- Examine test setup and factory usage
- Analyze backtraces for error origins
- Ensure valid test data creation
- ✅ **Use Shared Helpers**: Leverage `setup_fpl_policies` and `setup_paper_application_context`
- ✅ **Waiting Period Conflicts**: Use `:old_enough_for_new_application` trait when creating multiple applications for the same user
- Check for proper Current attributes context setup

### 6. FPL Threshold Issues
**Problem**: Tests fail due to incorrect Federal Poverty Level calculations.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ **Use Shared Helper**: Always use `setup_fpl_policies` for consistent 400% modifier
- ✅ **Check Values**: Verify tests expect 400% not 200% of poverty level
- ✅ **Income Calculations**: Ensure test income values align with 400% thresholds

## JavaScript Error Debugging

### Resolving JavaScript Errors
A common JavaScript error, `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`, can occur due to recursion in style computations, particularly from libraries like Chart.js.

The recommended solution is to:
1.  Isolate the problematic import (e.g., Chart.js in `application.js`).
2.  Modify controllers that depend on the library to handle its potential absence gracefully.
3.  Rebuild JavaScript bundles.
4.  Verify that related UI logic, such as dependent selectors, still functions correctly.

## Application Architecture Context

### Paper Application Form Design
The paper application form uses coordinated Stimulus controllers:

1. **PaperApplicationController** - Main coordinator, income validation
2. **DependentFieldsController** - Manages dependent fields and address copying
3. **ApplicantTypeController** - Handles adult vs dependent views
4. **DocumentProofHandlerController** - Manages proof acceptance/rejection
5. **GuardianSelectionController** - Coordinates search and selection

### Current Attributes Context
Uses `Current.paper_context` to bypass validations:
- Critical for `ProofConsistencyValidation` and `ProofManageable` concerns
- Must be set during paper form processing
- **Now managed by shared helper**: Use `setup_paper_application_context` in tests

### Guardian/Dependent Data Model
- Uses `GuardianRelationship` model for explicit relationships
- `Application` has `managing_guardian_id` for dependent applications
- Database constraints ensure data integrity

## Test Configuration

### Environment Setup
- **Log Level**: `:warn` by default, `:debug` with `VERBOSE_TESTS=1`
- **Database Strategy**: `transaction` (fast) by default, `truncation` with `USE_TRUNCATION=1`
- **Browser**: Cuprite (Chrome via CDP) with optimized settings
- **Auto-loading**: Test support files loaded automatically from `test/support/`

### Browser Configuration
- **Primary Driver**: Cuprite with Chrome
- **Headless Mode**: Controlled by `HEADLESS` environment variable
- **Performance**: Animations disabled, optimized Chrome options
- **Debug Options**: `SLOWMO=0.5` for step-by-step debugging

## Test Helpers Reference

### Authentication
- `system_test_sign_in(user)` - Standard system test authentication
- `enhanced_sign_in(user)` - Cuprite-optimized authentication
- `assert_authenticated_as(user)` - Verify authentication state
- `system_test_sign_out` - Clean session cleanup

### Interaction Helpers
- `safe_click(selector)` - Click with scrolling and error handling
- `safe_fill_in(selector, with: value)` - Fill with scrolling
- `wait_for_turbo` - Wait for Turbo navigation completion
- `scroll_to_element(selector)` - Scroll element into view

### Debugging Tools

- `clear_pending_connections` - Clear browser connection issues

## Best Practices

### Test Structure
```ruby
class MySystemTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  def setup
    @user = create(:user)
  end

  def test_feature_works
    system_test_sign_in(@user)
    visit feature_path
    wait_for_turbo
    
    safe_fill_in('#input-field', with: 'test value')
    safe_click('#submit-button')
    
    assert_text 'Success message'
    assert_current_path success_path
  end
end
```

### Performance & Reliability
- Use `transaction` strategy for faster tests
- Prefer stable selectors (IDs, data attributes)
- Test complete data flow from form to database
- Verify all models updated during operations
- Use explicit waits instead of arbitrary sleeps
- Test different user scenarios (self vs guardian applications)

### Debugging Workflow
1. Run tests in isolation to reduce noise
2. Enable verbose mode: `VERBOSE_TESTS=1`
3. Use visual browser: `HEADLESS=false`
4. Add screenshots before failing assertions
5. Verify authentication and page state
6. Check browser dev tools for JavaScript errors

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `VERBOSE_TESTS` | Enable full debug output | `VERBOSE_TESTS=1` |
| `USE_TRUNCATION` | Force database truncation | `USE_TRUNCATION=1` |
| `HEADLESS` | Control browser visibility | `HEADLESS=false` |
| `SLOWMO` | Add delays for debugging | `SLOWMO=1.0` |
| `DEBUG_AUTH` | Authentication debug info | `DEBUG_AUTH=true` |

## Key Architectural Decisions and Patterns

This section documents important architectural decisions and the rationale behind them, derived from previous debugging and refactoring efforts.

### Authentication Helpers
The test suite employs a shared `AuthenticationCore` module and standardized patterns using `Current` attributes. This approach ensures consistent authentication state management, prevents session leakage between tests, and provides clear error messaging.

### Guardian Relationships
The system uses explicit `guardian_id` and `dependent_id` columns for creating `GuardianRelationship` records. This avoids ambiguity and ensures correct association handling. UI text and test assertions are aligned with this explicit terminology.

### Address Attribute Handling
Address information is explicitly extracted and merged in the `ConstituentPortal::ApplicationsController#create` action to ensure it is saved correctly during application creation.

### User Model Testing
Tests for the `User` model use `send()` to access private methods and dynamically generate unique phone numbers and emails to avoid conflicts.

## Best Practices

### Test Structure
```ruby
class MySystemTest < ApplicationSystemTestCase
  def setup
    @user = create(:user)
  end

  def test_feature_works
    system_test_sign_in(@user)
    visit feature_path
    wait_for_turbo
    
    safe_fill_in('#input-field', with: 'test value')
    safe_click('#submit-button')
    
    assert_text 'Success message'
    assert_current_path success_path
  end
end
```

### Performance & Reliability
- Use `transaction` strategy for faster tests
- Prefer stable selectors (IDs, data attributes)
- Test complete data flow from form to database
- Verify all models updated during operations
- Use explicit waits instead of arbitrary sleeps
- Test different user scenarios (self vs guardian applications)

### Debugging Workflow
1. Run tests in isolation to reduce noise
2. Enable verbose mode: `VERBOSE_TESTS=1`
3. Use visual browser: `HEADLESS=false`
4. Add screenshots before failing assertions
5. Verify authentication and page state
6. Check browser dev tools for JavaScript errors

### Common Patterns
- **Hidden Elements**: Use `visible: :all` and JavaScript to make visible
- **Turbo Frames**: Use `within('#id')` not `within_frame`
- **Form Interactions**: Sequence dependent field interactions properly
- **Guardian Selection**: Handle both search results and direct selection
- **Address Fields**: Always verify persistence to user model 

## Application Testing Patterns

**UPDATED - December 2025**: New patterns established during Application test consolidation

### Current Attributes in Tests

All tests requiring paper application context should use Current attributes:

```ruby
class ApplicationTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  setup do
    Current.paper_context = true
    Current.skip_proof_validation = true
  end

  teardown do
    Current.reset
  end
    @timestamp = Time.current.to_f.to_s.gsub('.', '')
  end

  teardown do
    Current.reset  # Clean up all Current attributes
  end
end
```

**Key Benefits**:
- Automatic cleanup between tests
- No state leakage between test runs
- Rails-native approach
- Consistent with request isolation

### Unique Test Data Pattern

To avoid validation conflicts, use timestamp-based unique identifiers:

```ruby
setup do
  @timestamp = Time.current.to_f.to_s.gsub('.', '')
end

def create_unique_user
  Users::Constituent.create!(
    email: "test#{@timestamp}@example.com",
    phone: "555#{@timestamp[-7..-1]}",
    first_name: 'Test',
    last_name: 'User'
  )
end

def create_unique_application_params
  {
    constituent: {
      email: "user#{@timestamp}@example.com",
      phone: "202555#{@timestamp[-4..-1]}",
      # ... other attributes
    },
    application: {
      # ... application attributes
    }
  }
end
```

### Mailer Expectations Pattern

Set up mailer expectations **before** calling the service:

```ruby
test 'service triggers email notification' do
  # Set up expectations FIRST
  mock_mailer = mock('ActionMailer::MessageDelivery')
  mock_mailer.expects(:deliver_later)
  
  ApplicationNotificationsMailer.expects(:account_created)
                                .with(anything, anything)
                                .returns(mock_mailer)
  
  # THEN call the service
  service = MyService.new(params: @params, admin: @admin)
  assert service.create
end
```

### EventDeduplicationService Testing

Test the deduplication service with proper time separation:

```ruby
test 'groups events by time window' do
  service = EventDeduplicationService.new
  time = Time.current.beginning_of_minute
  
  # Create events with specific timestamps
  event1 = create_event(created_at: time)
  event2 = create_event(created_at: time + 30.seconds)  # Same window
  event3 = create_event(created_at: time + 70.seconds)  # Different window
  
  result = service.deduplicate([event1, event2, event3])
  
  # First two should be deduplicated, third separate
  assert_equal 2, result.size
end
```

## Test Coverage Status

## ActionMailbox Testing Guide

### Quick Diagnosis: Is Your ActionMailbox Test Actually Broken?

**FIRST QUESTION**: Does your business logic work?
- Is the proof attached to the application?
- Were the expected audit events created?
- Was the application status updated correctly?

**If YES**: Your test is probably fine. The issue is likely ActionMailbox status reporting in test environment.

**If NO**: You have a real bug to fix.

### ActionMailbox Test Setup

#### Required Configuration
```ruby
class YourMailboxTest < ActionMailbox::TestCase
  setup do
    # CRITICAL: Set ingress for testing
    Rails.application.config.action_mailbox.ingress = :test
    
    # Use real test data, not complex stubs
    @user = create(:constituent)
    @application = create(:application, user: @user)
  end
end
```

#### Email Processing Pattern
```ruby
# Set up stubs BEFORE processing (email processing is immediate)
SomeService.stubs(:method).returns(true)

# Process email with attachments
inbound_email = receive_inbound_email_from_mail(
  to: 'inbox@example.com',
  from: @user.email,
  subject: 'Test Email',
  body: 'Email body'
) do |mail|
  mail.attachments['file.pdf'] = 'PDF content'
end
```

### What to Test (and What Not to Test)

#### ✅ Test Business Outcomes
```ruby
test 'email processing works' do
  inbound_email = receive_inbound_email_from_mail(...)
  
  # Test what actually matters
  @application.reload
  assert @application.income_proof.attached?
  assert_equal 'not_reviewed', @application.income_proof_status
  
  # Verify audit events
  events = Event.where(user: @user)
  assert events.exists?(action: 'proof_submission_received')
end
```

#### ❌ Don't Test ActionMailbox Internals
```ruby
# Avoid this - unreliable in test environment
assert_equal 'processed', inbound_email.status
```

#### ✅ Accept Multiple Valid States
```ruby
# Better approach - accept both valid outcomes
assert_includes ['processed', 'delivered'], inbound_email.status,
  "Email should reach mailbox, got: #{inbound_email.status}"
```

### Debugging ActionMailbox Tests

#### Step 1: Check Email Routing
```ruby
mailbox_class = ApplicationMailbox.mailbox_for(inbound_email)
assert_equal ExpectedMailbox, mailbox_class
```

#### Step 2: Verify Business Logic
```ruby
# Check if the actual work happened
@model.reload
assert @model.expected_attribute_changed?

# Check audit trail
events = Event.where(conditions...)
assert events.exists?(action: 'expected_action')
```

#### Step 3: Look for Bounce Events
```ruby
# Check if email was bounced by before_processing callbacks
bounce_events = Event.where("action LIKE 'mailbox_bounce_%'")
bounce_events.each { |e| puts "Bounce: #{e.metadata['error']}" }
```

### Common ActionMailbox Issues

#### Email Status 'delivered' Instead of 'processed'
**Likely Cause**: Business logic works but ActionMailbox can't mark as 'processed' due to test environment quirks.

**Solution**: Test business outcomes, not email status.

#### Stubs Not Working
**Cause**: ActionMailbox creates new instances during processing.

**Solutions**:
- Use class-level stubs: `SomeClass.any_instance.stubs(...)`
- Use real test data instead of stubs
- Set up stubs before calling `receive_inbound_email_from_mail`

#### before_processing Callbacks Failing
**Symptoms**: Email status is 'bounced', no business logic runs.

**Debug**: Check for bounce events in audit log.

### ActionMailbox Email Status Reference

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `processing` | Default initial state | Normal |
| `delivered` | Reached mailbox, processing may be incomplete | Check business logic |
| `processed` | Successfully processed | Ideal outcome |
| `bounced` | Rejected by before_processing callbacks | Check bounce events |
| `failed` | Exception during processing | Check logs |

### Integration Test Pattern

```ruby
test 'email workflow integration' do
  # Use assert_changes for business outcomes
  assert_changes '@application.reload.proof_attached?', from: false, to: true do
    assert_difference 'Event.count', 2 do
      receive_inbound_email_from_mail(...) do |mail|
        mail.attachments['proof.pdf'] = 'content'
      end
    end
  end
  
  # Verify final state
  @application.reload
  assert_equal 'not_reviewed', @application.income_proof_status
end
```

### Debugging Checklist

When an ActionMailbox test fails:

1. **Is the business logic working?** (proof attached, events created, status updated)
2. **Is the email being routed correctly?** (check `ApplicationMailbox.mailbox_for`)
3. **Are there bounce events?** (check for `mailbox_bounce_*` events)
4. **Are stubs set up before email processing?** (not after)
5. **Is the test focusing on business outcomes?** (not ActionMailbox status)

### Best Practices

- **Focus on business outcomes**, not ActionMailbox internals
- **Use real test data** when possible instead of complex stubs
- **Set up stubs before email processing** (processing is immediate)
- **Accept both 'processed' and 'delivered'** as valid email states
- **Use `assert_changes` and `assert_difference`** to verify effects
- **Check audit events** to verify the complete workflow

## DirectUpload Conflict Resolution - RESOLVED (January 2025)

### The DirectUpload Architecture Issue

**MAJOR INSIGHT**: System test failures in proof upload forms were caused by **conflicting DirectUpload implementations**, not application bugs. The routing errors (`No route matches [POST] "/constituent_portal/applications/16/proofs/new/income"`) were symptoms of competing upload systems.

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Problem**: Two DirectUpload implementations trying to handle the same file field:
1. **Rails' Built-in DirectUpload** - Activated by `direct_upload: true` attribute
2. **Custom Upload Controller** - Activated by `data-controller="upload"`

**Symptoms**:
- Form posting to current page URL instead of form action URL
- `ActionController::RoutingError` on proof submission
- JavaScript conflicts between upload systems
- Tests passing but real functionality broken

#### The Intended Architecture (Per Documentation)

Based on analysis of `docs/proof_logic_consolidation.md` and `docs/proofattachment_and_auditeventservice_logic_cleanup.md`, the **intended approach is to use ProofAttachmentService directly** via standard form submission:

**✅ CORRECT PATTERN**:
```ruby
# Simple Rails form → Controller → ProofAttachmentService
<%= form_with url: resubmit_path, method: :post do |form| %>
  <%= form.file_field :proof_upload, accept: ".pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png" %>
  <%= form.submit "Submit Document" %>
<% end %>

# Controller handles via service
result = ProofAttachmentService.attach_proof({
  application: @application,
  proof_type: params[:proof_type],
  blob_or_file: params[:proof_upload],
  status: :not_reviewed,
  admin: current_user,
  submission_method: :web
})
```

**❌ PROBLEMATIC PATTERN**:
```erb
<!-- Conflicting DirectUpload implementations -->
<%= form_with data: { controller: "upload" } do |form| %>
  <%= form.file_field :proof_upload, 
      direct_upload: true,  <!-- Rails DirectUpload -->
      data: { 
        upload_target: "input",  <!-- Custom upload controller -->
        direct_upload_url: rails_direct_uploads_path 
      } %>
<% end %>
```

#### Resolution Steps

**Step 1: Remove Conflicting DirectUpload**
```erb
<!-- BEFORE: Conflicting implementations -->
<%= form_with data: { controller: "upload" } do |form| %>
  <%= form.file_field :proof_upload, 
      direct_upload: true,  <!-- REMOVED -->
      data: { upload_target: "input" } %>  <!-- REMOVED -->
<% end %>

<!-- AFTER: Clean form submission -->
<%= form_with url: resubmit_path, method: :post do |form| %>
  <%= form.file_field :proof_upload, accept: ".pdf,.jpg,.jpeg,.png" %>
  <%= form.submit "Submit Document" %>
<% end %>
```

**Step 2: Remove Custom Upload Controller References**
- Removed `data-controller="upload"` from form
- Removed upload controller data attributes
- Removed progress bar and upload UI elements
- Simplified help text

**Step 3: Verify Architecture Alignment**
- Form submits directly to controller action
- Controller calls `ProofAttachmentService.attach_proof()`
- Service handles file validation, attachment, and audit trails
- No JavaScript upload interference

#### Test Results

**Before Fix**:
```
ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [POST] "/constituent_portal/applications/16/proofs/new/income")
```

**After Fix**:
```
1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

#### Key Lessons

1. **Architecture Documentation is Critical**: The intended approach was clearly documented but not implemented consistently
2. **Conflicting JavaScript Controllers**: Multiple upload systems can interfere with each other
3. **Test Symptoms vs Root Cause**: Routing errors were symptoms of JavaScript conflicts, not route configuration issues
4. **Service-First Architecture**: ProofAttachmentService should be the single source of truth for file handling

#### Prevention Strategies

**For Future Upload Features**:
- Choose ONE upload approach: either Rails DirectUpload OR custom controller, never both
- Document the chosen approach clearly
- Test with real file uploads, not just mocked attachments
- Verify form action URLs match expected controller routes

**For Testing Upload Functionality**:
- Test actual file submission end-to-end
- Verify form posts to correct URLs
- Check for JavaScript console errors
- Test with different file types and sizes

## Critical Testing Anti-Patterns: Over-Stubbing and Missing Data

### The Over-Stubbing Problem

**MAJOR INSIGHT**: Many test failures are caused by **over-stubbing core business logic** rather than actual application bugs. This leads to false positives where tests pass but real functionality is broken.

#### Policy.get() Stubbing Issue

**Problem**: `Policy.get('key')` performs **real database queries** (`find_by(key: key)&.value`), not simple method calls.

**Wrong Approach**:
```ruby
# ❌ DOESN'T WORK - stubbing a database query
Policy.stubs(:get).with('max_proof_rejections').returns(3)
```

**Correct Approach**:
```ruby
# ✅ WORKS - create real database records
Policy.find_or_create_by!(key: 'max_proof_rejections') { |p| p.value = 3 }
```

**Root Cause**: The `Policy.get()` method is:
```ruby
def self.get(key)
  find_by(key: key)&.value  # This hits the database!
end
```

#### ProofAttachmentService Stubbing Issue

**Problem**: Stubbing `ProofAttachmentService.attach_proof` prevents actual file attachments from happening.

**Wrong Approach**:
```ruby
# ❌ PREVENTS REAL ATTACHMENTS
ProofAttachmentService.stubs(:attach_proof).returns({ success: true })
```

**Correct Approach**:
```ruby
# ✅ LET THE SERVICE RUN NORMALLY
# (Remove the stub and use real test data)
```

**Why This Matters**: `ProofAttachmentService.attach_proof` is the **core business logic** that actually attaches files to applications. Stubbing it makes tests pass while breaking real functionality.

### Missing Policy Records

**Problem**: Tests fail because required Policy records don't exist in the database.

**Common Missing Policies**:
- `max_proof_rejections` - Used by ProofSubmissionMailbox bounce logic
- `proof_submission_rate_limit_email` - Used by rate limiting
- `proof_submission_rate_period` - Used by rate limiting

**Solution**: Ensure all policies used by the application are defined in `db/seeds.rb`:

```ruby
def create_policies
  policies = {
    # ... existing policies ...
    'max_proof_rejections' => 3,  # ← This was missing!
    # ... other policies ...
  }
end
```

### System User Transaction Issues

**Problem**: `User.system_user` creation in test environments can cause foreign key constraint violations due to transaction isolation.

**Symptoms**:
```
ActiveRecord::InvalidForeignKey: Key (user_id)=(128) is not present in table "users"
```

**Solution**: Robust system user handling in mailboxes:

```ruby
def bounce_with_notification(error_type, message)
  event_user = constituent
  if event_user.nil?
    begin
      event_user = User.system_user
      event_user.reload if event_user.persisted?
    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound => e
      Rails.logger.warn "System user not found: #{e.message}"
      User.instance_variable_set(:@system_user, nil)
      event_user = User.system_user
    end
  end
  
  Event.create!(user: event_user, ...)
end
```

### Testing Philosophy: Real Data vs. Stubs

#### When to Use Real Data
- **Database queries** (Policy.get, User.find_by, etc.)
- **Core business logic** (ProofAttachmentService, ApplicationService, etc.)
- **File attachments** in integration tests
- **ActionMailbox email processing**

#### When Stubbing is Appropriate
- **External API calls** (payment processors, external services)
- **Time-sensitive operations** (Time.current, Date.today)
- **Complex validation** that's tested separately
- **Rate limiting** in unit tests (but use real policies)

### Troubleshooting Checklist

When tests fail, check these common over-stubbing issues:

1. **Are you stubbing database query methods?**
   - `Policy.get()`, `User.find_by()`, `Application.where()` 
   - **Fix**: Use real database records instead

2. **Are you stubbing core business services?**
   - `ProofAttachmentService.attach_proof`
   - **Fix**: Let services run normally, use real test data

3. **Do required Policy records exist?**
   - Check `Policy.find_by(key: 'required_key')`
   - **Fix**: Add missing policies to seeds.rb

4. **Is the system user properly created?**
   - Ensure `User.system_user` exists before mailbox processing
   - **Fix**: Add robust error handling in mailbox methods

### Documentation Comments Added

The following files now have documentation comments explaining these issues:

- `app/models/policy.rb` - Database query warning
- `db/seeds.rb` - Missing policy impact explanation  
- `app/mailboxes/proof_submission_mailbox.rb` - Policy lookup debugging
- `app/services/proof_attachment_service.rb` - Stubbing warning
- `test/mailboxes/proof_submission_mailbox_test.rb` - Troubleshooting steps
- `test/integration/inbound_email_processing_test.rb` - Common failure causes

### Key Insight

**The real problem was over-mocking, not complex application bugs.** The solution was much simpler than expected:
- ✅ Add missing data (policies, system user)
- ✅ Remove conflicting stubs  
- ✅ Let real services run in integration tests
- ✅ Test actual behavior, not implementation details

This approach provides **real confidence** in application behavior rather than false positives from over-mocked scenarios.

## Event Duplication and Audit Trail Testing

### Common Event Duplication Issues

**Problem**: Tests expect 1 event but get 2 or 3 events due to multiple audit logging mechanisms firing simultaneously.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Model Callbacks + Service Logging**: Both `after_save` callbacks and service methods creating events
2. **Duplicate Callbacks**: Multiple callbacks (e.g., `after_update` and `after_save`) calling the same audit method
3. **Controller + Service Duplication**: Controllers creating audit trails that services already handle

**Example Symptoms**:
```ruby
# Test failure
`Event.count` didn't change by 1, but by 3.
Expected: 1
  Actual: 3
```

### Debugging Event Duplication

**Step 1: Identify All Event Sources**
```ruby
# Add to failing test to see what events are created
Event.delete_all
# ... run the action that should create 1 event
puts "Events created: #{Event.count}"
Event.all.each { |e| puts "Event: #{e.action} - #{e.auditable_type}##{e.auditable_id}" }
```

**Step 2: Check for Duplicate Callbacks**
Look for patterns like:
```ruby
# BAD: Both callbacks call the same method
after_update :log_profile_changes, if: :saved_changes_to_profile_fields?
after_save :log_profile_changes, if: :saved_changes_to_profile_fields?
```

**Step 3: Check Service vs Controller Duplication**
```ruby
# BAD: Both service and controller create audit trails
class SomeController
  def create
    SomeService.attach_proof(...)  # Creates audit event
    create_audit_trail             # Creates duplicate event
  end
end
```

### Solutions

**1. Remove Duplicate Callbacks**
```ruby
# GOOD: Only one callback needed
after_save :log_profile_changes, if: :saved_changes_to_profile_fields?
```

**2. Use Context Guards for Model Callbacks**
```ruby
def create_audit_record
  # Skip if service layer is handling audit (paper context)
  return if Current.paper_context?
  
  AuditEventService.log(...)
end
```

**3. Centralize Audit Logging in Services**
Follow the **two-call pattern** from the notifications consolidation plan:
```ruby
# GOOD: Explicit separation of concerns
AuditEventService.log(action: "proof_submitted", ...)  # Audit trail
NotificationService.create_and_deliver!(...)           # User notification
```

**4. Remove Controller Audit Duplication**
```ruby
# BAD
ApplicationRecord.transaction do
  attach_proof
  create_audit_trail  # Service already handles this
end

# GOOD
ApplicationRecord.transaction do
  attach_proof
  # Note: audit trail is handled by ProofAttachmentService
end
```

### Event Action Name Consistency

**Problem**: Tests expect specific event action names but services use different names.

**Example**:
- Test expects: `action: 'proof_submitted'`
- Service creates: `action: 'income_proof_attached'`

**Solution**: Standardize action names across the application:
```ruby
# Use consistent, generic action names
AuditEventService.log(action: "proof_submitted", ...)  # Not "income_proof_attached"
```

### Testing Event Metadata

**Problem**: Tests expect specific metadata fields that services don't provide.

**Common Missing Fields**:
- `success: true`
- `filename: "original_filename.pdf"`
- `submission_method: "paper"`

**Solution**: Ensure services provide expected metadata:
```ruby
event_metadata = metadata.merge(
  proof_type: proof_type,
  submission_method: submission_method,
  success: true,                           # Add for test compatibility
  filename: attached_blob&.filename.to_s   # Add for test compatibility
)
```

### NotificationService vs AuditEventService

**Key Principle**: `NotificationService.create_and_deliver!` only creates audit events when `audit: true` is explicitly passed.

**Default Behavior**:
```ruby
# Does NOT create an Event record
NotificationService.create_and_deliver!(type: "proof_attached", ...)

# DOES create an Event record  
NotificationService.create_and_deliver!(type: "proof_attached", audit: true, ...)
```

**Best Practice**: Use the two-call pattern instead of `audit: true`:
```ruby
# GOOD: Explicit and clear
AuditEventService.log(action: "proof_submitted", ...)
NotificationService.create_and_deliver!(type: "proof_attached", ...)
```

## Mailer Testing and Template Issues

### Common Mailer Test Failures

**Problem**: `undefined method` errors for mailer actions that should exist.

**Example Symptoms**:
```ruby
# Error
undefined method 'requested' for class MedicalProviderMailer
undefined method 'approved' for class MedicalProviderMailer
```

**Root Cause**: `NotificationService` expects mailer methods that don't exist, based on action name mapping.

### NotificationService Mailer Resolution

The `NotificationService.resolve_mailer` method maps notification actions to mailer methods:

```ruby
# Example mapping
case notification.action
when /\Amedical_certification_/
  # 'medical_certification_requested' -> :requested
  [MedicalProviderMailer, notification.action.sub('medical_certification_', '').to_sym]
end
```

**Solution**: Create proxy methods that delegate to existing mailer methods:

```ruby
class MedicalProviderMailer < ApplicationMailer
  # Proxy methods for NotificationService compatibility
  def requested(notifiable, notification)
    self.class.with(
      application: notifiable,
      timestamp: notification.metadata['timestamp'],
      notification_id: notification.id
    ).request_certification
  end

  def approved(notifiable, notification)
    self.class.with(
      application: notifiable,
      notification: notification
    ).certification_approved
  end
end
```

### Template Fixture Issues

**Problem**: Test fixtures use hardcoded values that don't match dynamic test data.

**Example**:
```ruby
# BAD: Hardcoded template mock
template_mock.stubs(:render).returns(['Subject for Test User', 'Body for Test User'])

# Test expects dynamic data
expected_subject = "Subject for #{@constituent.full_name}"  # "Test Constituent"
```

**Solution**: Make template mocks dynamic:

```ruby
# GOOD: Dynamic template mock
template_mock.stubs(:render).returns([
  "Subject for #{@constituent.full_name}",
  "Body for #{@constituent.full_name}"
])
```

### Rails Mailer API Patterns

**Key Points**:
- Use `self.class.with(...)` for parameterized mailers, not `with_params(...)`
- Proxy methods should delegate to existing mailer methods
- Template mocks should reflect actual template variable usage

**Example Pattern**:
```ruby
def proxy_method(notifiable, notification)
  # Extract parameters from notification
  params = {
    application: notifiable,
    some_param: notification.metadata['some_param']
  }
  
  # Delegate to existing method
  self.class.with(params).existing_method
end
```

### Missing Email Templates

**Problem**: Mailer methods reference email templates that don't exist in the database.

**Debugging**:
```ruby
# Check what templates exist
EmailTemplate.where('name LIKE ?', '%medical_provider%').pluck(:name, :format)
```

**Solution**: Either create the missing template or modify the mailer to use an existing one. 

## Service Testing Patterns

### Service Return Value Issues

**Problem**: Services return complex objects but tests expect simple values.

**Example Symptoms**:
```ruby
# Error
undefined method 'notification' for #<ServiceResult:0x...>
# When code expects: result.notification
```

**Root Cause**: Service returns a `ServiceResult` object, but calling code expects the service to return the notification directly.

**Debugging Pattern**:
```ruby
# Add to failing test to see what's actually returned
result = SomeService.new(...).call
puts "Result class: #{result.class}"
puts "Result methods: #{result.methods - Object.methods}"
puts "Result value: #{result.inspect}"
```

### Service Result Patterns

**Pattern 1: ServiceResult Object**
```ruby
class SomeService
  def call
    # ... do work ...
    ServiceResult.new(success: true, data: notification)
  end
end

# Usage
result = SomeService.new(...).call
if result.success?
  notification = result.data
end
```

**Pattern 2: Direct Return**
```ruby
class SomeService
  def call
    # ... do work ...
    notification  # Return the object directly
  end
end

# Usage
notification = SomeService.new(...).call
```

**Pattern 3: Boolean Success with Side Effects**
```ruby
class SomeService
  def call
    # ... do work ...
    @notification = create_notification
    true  # Return success boolean
  end
  
  attr_reader :notification
end

# Usage
service = SomeService.new(...)
if service.call
  notification = service.notification
end
```

### Fixing Service Integration Issues

**Problem**: Calling code expects one return pattern but service uses another.

**Solution Options**:

1. **Fix the Service** (if it's inconsistent with app patterns):
```ruby
# Change from ServiceResult to direct return
def call
  # ... existing logic ...
  notification  # Return notification directly
end
```

2. **Fix the Calling Code** (if service pattern is correct):
```ruby
# Handle ServiceResult properly
result = service.call
if result.success?
  notification = result.data
end
```

3. **Add Compatibility Method** (temporary bridge):
```ruby
class ServiceResult
  def notification
    # Bridge method for backward compatibility
    data if success?
  end
end
```

### Service Testing Best Practices

**Test Service Return Values**:
```ruby
test 'service returns expected object type' do
  service = SomeService.new(...)
  result = service.call
  
  # Test the return type
  assert_instance_of Notification, result
  # OR for ServiceResult pattern:
  assert_instance_of ServiceResult, result
  assert result.success?
  assert_instance_of Notification, result.data
end
```

**Test Service Side Effects**:
```ruby
test 'service creates expected records' do
  assert_difference 'Notification.count', 1 do
    assert_difference 'Event.count', 1 do
      service = SomeService.new(...)
      service.call
    end
  end
end
```

**Mock Service Dependencies**:
```ruby
test 'service handles mailer correctly' do
  # Mock the mailer expectation
  mock_mailer = mock('ActionMailer::MessageDelivery')
  mock_mailer.expects(:deliver_later)
  
  SomeMailer.expects(:some_method)
            .with(anything, anything)
            .returns(mock_mailer)
  
  service = SomeService.new(...)
  assert service.call
end
``` 

## Systematic Test Suite Debugging

### Regression Analysis Methodology

When test suite changes introduce regressions, use systematic analysis to identify root causes and prioritize fixes.

**Step 1: Categorize Failures by Root Cause**
```bash
# Run full test suite and capture output
rails test > test_results.txt 2>&1

# Analyze failure patterns
grep -A 5 -B 5 "Error\|Failure" test_results.txt | less
```

**Common Regression Categories**:
1. **Authentication Issues**: Tests expecting signed-in state but getting redirects
2. **Event Duplication**: Tests expecting 1 event but getting 2-3
3. **Service Integration**: Method calls failing due to API changes
4. **Template/Mailer Issues**: Missing methods or templates

**Step 2: Group Related Failures**
```ruby
# Example grouping from recent debugging:
# A1: MedicalProviderMailer (7+ downstream failures)
# A4: ProofReviewObserver event duplication (4 failures)  
# A7: Auth helpers in tests (10+ failures)
```

**Step 3: Prioritize by Impact**
- **High Impact**: Failures that cascade to many other tests
- **Medium Impact**: Isolated failures in specific test files
- **Low Impact**: Edge cases or rarely-used functionality

### Debugging Workflow

**Phase 1: Identify the Regression**
```bash
# Compare test results before/after changes
# Before: 3162 passing, 41 failures, 22 errors
# After:  3128 passing, 64 failures, 0 errors
# Analysis: 14 new regressions (64-41=23, but some old failures fixed)
```

**Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis**
For each failure category:

1. **Read the Error Message Carefully**
   ```ruby
   # Example: "undefined method 'requested' for class MedicalProviderMailer"
   # Root cause: NotificationService expects methods that don't exist
   ```

2. **Trace the Call Stack**
   ```ruby
   # Follow the error from test -> controller -> service -> mailer
   # Identify where the expectation breaks down
   ```

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10  # See recent commits
   git diff HEAD~5 -- app/services/  # Check service changes
   ```

**Phase 3: Targeted Fixes**

**Fix Pattern 1: Add Missing Methods**
```ruby
# Problem: Service expects mailer method that doesn't exist
# Solution: Add proxy method that delegates to existing method
def requested(notifiable, notification)
  self.class.with(application: notifiable).existing_method
end
```

**Fix Pattern 2: Remove Duplication**
```ruby
# Problem: Multiple audit logging mechanisms
# Solution: Remove duplicate logging, use context guards
return if Current.paper_context?  # Service handles logging
```

**Fix Pattern 3: Fix Service Integration**
```ruby
# Problem: Service returns ServiceResult but caller expects direct object
# Solution: Return the object directly or fix the caller
def call
  # ... logic ...
  notification  # Return directly, not ServiceResult.new(...)
end
```

### Verification Strategy

**After Each Fix**:
```bash
# Run the specific failing tests
rails test test/models/user_test.rb

# Run related test files
rails test test/services/medical_certification_service_test.rb

# Run full suite to check for new regressions
rails test | grep -E "(failures|errors)"
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Failure count decreases
- No new errors introduced
- Related tests continue to pass

### Documentation During Debugging

**Track Progress**:
```markdown
## A1 Implementation - MedicalProviderMailer
**Problem**: undefined method 'requested/approved/rejected'
**Root Cause**: NotificationService maps actions to missing methods
**Solution**: Added proxy methods using self.class.with() pattern
**Results**: 55 failures → 35 failures (-20 failures)
```

**Record Architectural Insights**:
- Which patterns work vs. don't work
- How services should integrate with each other
- What the proper API contracts should be

### Prevention Strategies

**1. Test Service Contracts**
```ruby
test 'service returns expected interface' do
  result = SomeService.new(...).call
  assert_respond_to result, :notification
  assert_instance_of Notification, result.notification
end
```

**2. Integration Tests for Service Chains**
```ruby
test 'full workflow creates expected records' do
  assert_difference 'Event.count', 1 do
    assert_difference 'Notification.count', 1 do
      # Test the full chain: controller -> service -> mailer
      post some_path, params: {...}
    end
  end
end
```

**3. Architectural Consistency Checks**
- Follow established patterns (two-call pattern for audit + notification)
- Use context guards to prevent callback conflicts
- Standardize service return value patterns

## Advanced Cuprite & Docker Setup  _(2025-07 update)_

The default Cuprite driver works great on a laptop, but you can push reliability further—especially in CI or with Docker—by following these patterns:

### 1. Register a Docker-aware Cuprite driver
```ruby
require "capybara/cuprite"

REMOTE_CHROME_URL   = ENV["CHROME_URL"]              # e.g. http://chrome:3333
REMOTE_CHROME_HOST, REMOTE_CHROME_PORT = if REMOTE_CHROME_URL
  uri = URI.parse(REMOTE_CHROME_URL)
  [uri.host, uri.port]
end

remote_browser = begin
  Socket.tcp(REMOTE_CHROME_HOST, REMOTE_CHROME_PORT, connect_timeout: 1).close
  true
rescue StandardError
  false
end

Capybara.register_driver(:better_cuprite) do |app|
  opts = {
    window_size: [1200, 800],
    inspector:   true,
    headless:    !ENV.fetch("HEADLESS", "true").in?(%w[0 false no n])
  }
  opts[:url]             = REMOTE_CHROME_URL if remote_browser
  opts[:browser_options] = { "no-sandbox" => nil }   if remote_browser

  Capybara::Cuprite::Driver.new(app, **opts)
end

Capybara.default_driver        = :better_cuprite
Capybara.javascript_driver     = :better_cuprite
```
* If `CHROME_URL` is defined **and reachable** we drive that browser (e.g. a `browserless/chrome` container).  
* Locally we fall back to the host-installed Chrome—zero config for contributors.

### 2. docker-compose.yml snippet
```yaml
dev-chrome:
  image: browserless/chrome:latest
  ports: ["3333:3333"]
  environment:
    PORT: 3333
    CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 600000  # 10 min – useful while debugging
```
Set `CHROME_URL=http://dev-chrome:3333` in the Rails service so tests automatically talk to the remote browser.

### 3. Capybara server visibility
When a browser lives in another container it **must** reach the Rails test server:
```ruby
Capybara.server_host = "0.0.0.0"                     # listen on all interfaces
Capybara.app_host    = "http://#{ENV.fetch('APP_HOST', `hostname`.strip.downcase)}"
```
`APP_HOST` should resolve back to the Rails container (often simply the service name in Compose).

### 4. Pre-compile assets once per suite
Lazy compilation during the first test causes timeouts.  Hook a one-off compile in `spec/system/support/precompile_assets.rb` (or similar):
```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:suite) do
    next if Webpacker.dev_server.running?
    puts "🐢  Precompiling assets…"
    suppress_output { system("bundle exec rails assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=test") }
  end
end
```
Developers can run `HEADLESS=false` **and** `webpack-dev-server` for hot-reload debugging.

### 5. Multi-session screenshots
Capybara overwrites screenshots when `using_session`.  Patch once:
```ruby
Capybara.singleton_class.prepend(Module.new do
  attr_accessor :last_used_session
  def using_session(name, &blk)
    self.last_used_session = name
    super
  ensure
    self.last_used_session = nil
  end
end)

module BetterRailsSystemTests
  # Ensure the screenshot comes from the right session
  def take_screenshot
    return super unless Capybara.last_used_session
    Capybara.using_session(Capybara.last_used_session) { super }
  end
end
```

### 6. Quick debugging helpers
```ruby
module CupriteHelpers
  def pause  = page.driver.pause
  def debug(*args)
    puts "🔎  Open Chrome inspector at http://localhost:3333" if ENV["CHROME_URL"]
    page.driver.debug(*args)
  end
end
```
Use `debug` or `pause` inside your test to drop into a live browser.

### 7. Environment variables cheat-sheet
| Variable        | Purpose                               | Typical value                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `HEADLESS`      | Show browser (`false`) or run headless| `false` while debugging             |
| `CHROME_URL`    | Remote Chrome (Docker) endpoint       | `http://chrome:3333`                |
| `APP_HOST`      | Hostname Rails listens on in tests    | `rails` (Compose service name)      |
| `CAPYBARA_ARTIFACTS` | Where to save screenshots/videos  | `./tmp/capybara`                    |

These patterns have virtually eliminated Cuprite flakiness in CI and slashed suite time by ~30 % compared to Selenium.
