# MAT Vulcan Documentation Hub

A roadmap to **every doc, guide, and reference** in the repositoryâ€”so devs and AI helpers can jump straight to what they need.

---

## 1 Â· Quick Start

| Step | Where to look | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| **1. Feature Overview** | `current_application_features.md` | Know what the app does right now. |
| **2. Test & Debug** | `development/testing_and_debugging_guide.md` | Local setup, CurrentAttributes patterns, debugger tips. |
| **3. Service Patterns** | `development/service_architecture.md` | Understand how business logic is encapsulated. |

> **Tip:** Search the **development/** folder first for any "how do Iâ€¦?" question -â€” most implementation guides live there.

## 3 Â· Doc-Hunting Tips for AI Assistants

| Need | Where to search |
|------|-----------------|
| "How does X feature work?" | `current_application_features.md`, then specific file in **features/** |
| "Which service owns Y?" | `development/service_architecture.md` |
| "What JS pattern should I follow?" | `development/javascript_architecture.md` |
| "Where's the email config?" | `infrastructure/email_system.md` |
| "Upcoming tasks?" | `future_work/mat_vulcan_todos.md` |

Naming is grep-friendly: *feature names* mirror folder/file names, so `"guardian_relationship_system"` appears exactly once per folder.
