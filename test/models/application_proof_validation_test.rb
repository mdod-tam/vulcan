# Tests for Application model proof attachment validations
#
# These tests verify the validation rules defined in ProofManageable concern:
# - File type restrictions (PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP)
# - File size limit (5MB)
# - Required attachments based on application status
#
# Related files:
# - app/models/concerns/proof_manageable.rb - Contains validation logic
# - app/models/application.rb - Includes the ProofManageable concern
# - app/mailboxes/proof_submission_mailbox.rb - Uses these validations
