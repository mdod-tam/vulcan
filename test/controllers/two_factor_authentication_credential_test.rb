# Two-Factor Authentication Credential Management Tests
#
# These integration tests verify the WebAuthn credential management functionality:
# 1. Creating new WebAuthn credentials (security keys/biometrics)
# 2. Retrieving WebAuthn creation options
# 3. Secure deletion of credentials
# 4. Security boundary enforcement
#
# The credential management flow consists of these key steps:
# 1. User authenticates with password
# 2. User accesses credential management interface
# 3. For creation: browser requests options from server, creates credential, sends to server
# 4. For deletion: user selects credential to remove, server verifies ownership
#
# Note: These tests use FactoryBot instead of fixtures to create test users and credentials,
# ensuring test consistency and better reflecting real application usage patterns.
