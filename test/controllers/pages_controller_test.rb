# PHASE 5 FIX NOTES:
# As noted in test_suite_fixing_guide.md Phase 5, PagesControllerTest is encountering
# 404 errors despite the routes being correctly defined and the views existing.
# This appears to be related to how authentication and routing works in the test environment.

  # The 404 issues will be addressed comprehensively later in the test suite fixing process
