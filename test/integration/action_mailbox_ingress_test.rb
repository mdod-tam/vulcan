# frozen_string_literal: true

# Tests the basic functionality of ActionMailbox routing rules
#
# This test verifies that the ActionMailbox routes are properly
# configured without attempting to actually process the emails,
# which is tested separately in the individual mailbox tests.
#
# Key dependencies:
# - MatVulcan::InboundEmailConfig - config/initializers/01_inbound_email_config.rb
# - app/mailboxes/application_mailbox.rb - Contains routing rules
# - app/mailboxes/proof_submission_mailbox.rb
# - app/mailboxes/medical_certification_mailbox.rb
