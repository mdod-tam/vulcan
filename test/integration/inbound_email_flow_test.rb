# Integration test for inbound email processing via webhook
# Tests the full flow from receiving a webhook POST to processing the email through ActionMailbox
#
# Key dependencies:
# - MatVulcan::InboundEmailConfig - Defined in config/initializers/01_inbound_email_config.rb
# - MailboxTestHelper - Defined in test/support/mailbox_test_helper.rb
# - ProofSubmissionMailbox - Defined in app/mailboxes/proof_submission_mailbox.rb
# - ActionMailbox configuration - Defined in config/initializers/02_action_mailbox.rb
#
# Note: The authentication mechanism for Postmark webhooks uses HTTP Basic Auth
# with username 'actionmailbox' and password from Rails.application.config.action_mailbox.ingress_password
