    Dear %<user_first_name>s,

    ==================================================
    ✗ APPLICATION ARCHIVED
    ==================================================

    We regret to inform you that your application (ID: %<application_id>s) has been archived due to reaching the maximum number of document revision attempts.

    ==================================================
    ℹ WHAT THIS MEANS
    ==================================================

    Your current application cannot proceed further in the review process. However, you are welcome to submit a new application after %<reapply_date_formatted>s.

    WHY APPLICATIONS ARE ARCHIVED
    Applications may be archived when we are unable to verify eligibility after multiple attempts. This is typically due to:
    * Missing or incomplete documentation
    * Documentation that doesn't meet program requirements
    * Inability to verify residency or income information

    FUTURE APPLICATIONS
    When submitting a new application after %<reapply_date_formatted>s, please ensure you have the following ready:
    * Current proof of Maryland residency
    * Recent income documentation
    * Any medical documentation required for the program

    If you have any questions about this decision or need assistance with a future application, please contact our support team.
