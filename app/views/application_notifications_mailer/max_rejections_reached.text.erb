Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,

==================================================
✗ APPLICATION ARCHIVED
==================================================

We regret to inform you that your application (ID: <%= @application.id %>) has been archived due to reaching the maximum number of document revision attempts.

==================================================
ℹ WHAT THIS MEANS
==================================================

Your current application cannot proceed further in the review process. However, you are welcome to submit a new application after <%= @reapply_date.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %>.

WHY APPLICATIONS ARE ARCHIVED
Applications may be archived when we are unable to verify eligibility after multiple attempts. This is typically due to:
* Missing or incomplete documentation
* Documentation that doesn't meet program requirements
* Inability to verify residency or income information

FUTURE APPLICATIONS
When submitting a new application after <%= @reapply_date.strftime("%B %d, %Y") %>, please ensure you have the following ready:
* Current proof of Maryland residency
* Recent income documentation
* Any medical documentation required for the program

If you have any questions about this decision or need assistance with a future application, please contact our support team.
