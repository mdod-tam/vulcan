# Controller for handling proof submissions from constituents through the portal
#
# This controller handles the constituent-facing proof submission workflow:
# 1. Initial proof upload setup
# 2. Direct upload for client-side uploading to S3
# 3. Proof resubmission (after rejection)
#
# Note: This controller handles the UI and workflow for proof submission, and
# the actual attachment is delegated to ProofAttachmentService to maintain
# consistency with the paper application submission path. Both constituent portal
# and paper submissions use ProofAttachmentService as the single source of truth for proof attachments.
