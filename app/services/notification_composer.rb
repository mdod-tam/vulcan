# frozen_string_literal: true

# Composes user-facing messages for notifications.
# This service decouples message content from the Notification model and decorator,
# providing a single source of truth for all notification text. This makes
# testing, maintenance, and future localization much simpler.
#
# Usage:
#   NotificationComposer.generate(
#     notification.action,
#     notification.notifiable,
#     notification.actor,
#     notification.metadata
#   )
#
class NotificationComposer
  include ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper # For helpers like pluralize

  def self.generate(notification_action, notifiable, actor = nil, metadata = {})
    new(notification_action, notifiable, actor, metadata).generate
  end

  def initialize(action, notifiable, actor, metadata)
    @action = action.to_s
    @notifiable = notifiable
    @actor = actor
    @metadata = metadata || {}
  end

  def generate
    method_name = "message_for_#{@action}"
    if respond_to?(method_name, true)
      send(method_name)
