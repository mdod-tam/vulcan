# ProofManageable provides proof document management capabilities for applications.
#
# This concern handles the core model-level responsibilities for income and residency
# proof documents, including:
# - ActiveStorage attachment definitions
# - Basic validation of file types and sizes
# - Status checking methods for proof approval states
# - Model-level callbacks for proof state changes
#
# For complex operations like attachment processing, review workflows, and audit
# trails, this concern delegates to dedicated services:
# - ProofAttachmentService: Handles file uploads and audit trails
# - Applications::ProofReviewer: Manages the review process
# - ProofReviewService: Orchestrates proof reviews
#
# @example Basic usage
#   application = Application.find(123)
#   application.all_proofs_approved?  # => true/false
#   application.can_submit_proof?     # => true/false
#
# @see ProofAttachmentService For file upload operations
# @see Applications::ProofReviewer For review workflow management
# @see ProofReview For review record management
